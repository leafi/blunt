# Rules

* Take a deep breath. Don't worry. Release that breath. We're all hacks. Try and have some fun, yeah?
* When's the last time you wrote some music? I know no-one else likes your music, but that's okay. It's fun to not code too. You are a creative at heart. I believe in you.
* Break all of these rules at least once.
* Don't stick out. Conformity is your in. You're playing the long game. The really, *really* long game.
* Golang is just relaxed C, plus channels. The garbage collector is there to make it easy. `go fmt` makes it all look right.
* Golang is not the right language to code games in. Do it anyway.
* Blunt must be used only for games. Otherwise it may simply explode.
* If anything breaks, it is your fault. Blunt is perfect for games. Maybe you were not writing a game?
* [Report it anyway](https://github.com/leafi/blunt). Be indignant. You *were* writing a game. A good one!
* You will need to modify Blunt. Sorry, you just will.
* Submit [pull requests](https://github.com/leafi/blunt) to the author of this fork, even for code I don't want. I'll put it in anyway.
* Have you been obstreperous today?
* Outsource what you need but can't do. Life is short and the asset store is cheap.
* If you avoid using a struct per conceptual object, we can get through the pause times together. I like big array slices and multiple `views` on an object. Don't be like Minecraft. Unless you like being successful by every metric that matters.
* No googling.
* Everyone must be able to play your non-game. Code for all platforms, battlestations, terrible laptops and microconsoles. Provided they support bleeding-edge OpenGL extensions.
* O(1) render pass per category of graphical content. Cgo calls and the GC are slow. Like us they need slack.
* Tolerate intolerance. Do not swear.
* 'If you see a briar in the road, do not stop and say: what a shame.'
* (But the rule of funny always wins.)
* Blunt is supposed to be a MIT-licensed performant game engine for experimentation, one-off projects and fast cash generation. We want to reduce the friction of getting what's in your head into a computer. Submit a pull request for your lens flare editor. There will be a cash prize. [https://github.com/leafi/blunt](https://github.com/leafi/blunt)
* If Blunt's design is too limiting, steal parts of the codebase wholesale to fuel your own engine. Get on with it.
* Screw the GPL. I can't grow a beard. Sell ~~my~~ our code and keep the damn money.
* Focus on your core game loop. Skinner box. Port to iOS. Don't forget the coin shop and the nag screens.
* Extend the editor. Always implement infinite Undo.
* Persist to disk. Use Git. SVN for artists: Adobe tortures them enough.
* No, I don't know what I'm doing. And it doesn't matter.
* Submit additional rules by raising an issue or a pull request on the original GitHub. [https://github.com/leafi/blunt](https://github.com/leafi/blunt)
* Replace this file. Sorry about all this. I hope we can still be friends.
